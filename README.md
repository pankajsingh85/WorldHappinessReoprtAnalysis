My goal is find out what major factors caused country ranks or scores to change between the 2015 to 2019 reports and why countries are changing every year. I also want to know which countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness and did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness. I looked more closely at my target variable which is happiness score and this data will allow us to analyze it from thousands of individuals around the world and investigate the ways that makes people well-being. I looked at the rating and explore the extent to which people have negative or positive affective states in their day to day lives. The most informative attributes from this data are healthy life expectancy, family, freedom to choose what you do in life, generosity and how much people donate to charity, trust (Government Corruption), economy (GDP) In short, the current data could be fun and challenging to work with, but I tried my best to find the correlation between each variable.
